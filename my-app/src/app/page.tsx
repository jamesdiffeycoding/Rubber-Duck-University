            Why I built Rubber Duck Learning
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
            Developers often fail to build a deep understanding of the
            technologies they use. We build fast and we speedily complete
            courses; we enjoy the ride, but sometimes neglect taking the time to
            check (and reinforce) what weâ€™ve really learned along the way.
